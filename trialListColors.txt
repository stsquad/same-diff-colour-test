# First we need to define some colours used by the script
# define <name> <rgb values> <wav file>
define	red	1.0,0.0,0.0	stimuli/reds.wav
define	green	0.0,1.0,0.0  	stimuli/greens.wav
define	blue	0.0,0.0,1.0	stimuli/blues.wav

# These are the actual experiments. If the colour isn't defined
# earlier this will cause a problem.
