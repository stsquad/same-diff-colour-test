# Define Colours:
#   name: A label we use to describe the colour later in the
#   rgb values: The Red, Green, Blue components as floats 0.0-1.0
#   offset: The initial offset from ideal when we set up the Quest algo
#   wav file: A wav file we play for the audio prompt
#
# define <name> <rgb values>  <offset> 	       <wav file>
define	red	1.0,0.0,0.0   0.15	       stimuli/reds.wav
define  red-ul  1.0,0.0,0.0   0.15	       stimuli/colors.wav

# These are the actual experiments. If the colour isn't defined
# earlier this will cause a problem.
