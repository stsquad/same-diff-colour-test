# Define Colours:
#   name: A label we use to describe the colour later in the
#   rgb values: The Red, Green, Blue components as floats 0.0-1.0
#   offset: The initial offset from ideal when we set up the Quest
#   delta: The +/i variant for each step
#   wav file: A wav file we play for the audio prompt
#
# define <name> <rgb values>  <offset> <delta>	       <wav file>
